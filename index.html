  <h1>Conformal Cyclic Architectures</h1>
  <p>(December 2025 - Mendoza, Argentina)</p>
  <p>
  This work investigates a "Living Architecture" predicated on the geometric expansion and contraction of space. 
  By connecting MIT’s CarbonHouse initiative with Fuller’s legacy of Synergetic Geometry, 
  These projects utilize carbon-composite skins to realize high-performance polyhedral dwellings in extreme environments.

              "The rhythmic repetition of the mise- en- scène would seem to challenge another distinction articulated by Barthes: that between photography and cinema. 
              For in the cinema,
              <br>  
              the photograph, taken in flux, is impelled, is ceaselessly drawn towards other views;  .  .  .  
              there is always a photographic referent, but the referent shifts; it does not claim favor of its reality, it does not protest its former existence; 
              it does not cling to me: it is not a specter.10 
              <br>  
              In the photograph, by contrast, the subject is posed in front of the lens, not passed in front (and this even in ‘action’ photographs – the explosion of a drop of milk to a millionth of a second); 
              it is static, has no future, one’s gaze cannot drift – the unendurable cruelty of the still image (to which one is forced to submit, to look away from a photograph).
              Here, though, fluidity is imparted by virtue of the gently rhythmic cine-matographic splicing(s) undulating languidly across and out of frame. 
              The eye cannot help but follow such palpitation, ceaselessly searching for somewhere, something, to alight on (never finding it: remorseless image!). 
              Yet the scenes are  strangely  restless,  even  while  being  surrealistically  still;  not  just  in  the  oscillation of sense, but physically: a moving image trapped within a frame".

               "For Roland Barthes, the photograph is past and has no future: that is its pathos and its melancholy; 
               from which there follows a remorseless drift from presentation to retention. Here, the photograph has no past (or rather, such a past is 
               devotio moderna: essay on false impressions cancelled  with  a  deliberate  cut);  
               It exists as if a pure presentation (but one stained by the past), and yet, somehow, it also has no future, is melancholic. 
               This, for me, is what I must somehow explain: the lacerating grievance that attaches to these images despite their ‘liberating’ disturbance. 
               For they, too, seem somehow condemned in advance, a future anterior hanging over them  by  a  thin  thread.  
               We  shudder  over  a  catastrophe  which  has  already  occurred, but which here, by contrivance, we displace into the future: a pre-conceived  death.  
               These,  then,  not  post-  holocaust  landscapes,  record  of  an  autopsy; but, much rather, (for me) pre- holocaust: portrait of a people who have vanished, en masse, in anticipation of a future catastrophe.
               What is it that clutches at me here? Barthes, looking at a photograph of  his  now-  dead  mother  when  she  was  a  little  girl,  could  not  separate  the  knowledge of her final death from her image as a child. 
               But I find myself here projecting such sentiment into the future (no one has died) and in so doing acceding, even accelerating, Barthes’s feeling of the inherent melancholy of the photograph, just as I had thought I was escaping it.
               <br>
               Earlier societies managed so that memory, the substitute for life, was eternal, and that at least the thing that spoke of death should itself be immortal: this was the monument. 
               But by making photography into the general, and natural witness of ‘what has been’, modern society has renounced the monument. 
               But . . . the Photograph is a certain but fugitive testimony; so  that  everything,  today,  prepares  our  race  for  this  impotence:  to  be  no  longer able to conceive duration, affectively or symbolically: the age of the photograph  is  .  .  .  the  age  of  impatiences  .  .  .  of  everything  which  denies  ripening. 11
               <br> 
               Such  images,  plundering  that  very  repository  of  memory,  the  monument, by photography, grieve this loss but cannot escape it; they mime their own demise.  Such  (an)  architecture  –  that  has  seemingly  endured  (the  photo-graphic images bear witness to its age) – is itself unendurable. 
               It marks the passing of a nostalgia first attached to objects, then to images, then to the apparatus  of  replication  itself;  the  passing  of  the  age  of  the  photograph. 
               These are then the memorials of photographic memory, perhaps the passing of a visual sense . . . <a href="3.png" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;"> " </a>
